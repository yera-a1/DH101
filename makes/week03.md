DALL·E was used to generate and modify both of these images.
I uploaded an image and a prompt for the inital image generation, than an updated prompt to generate a second image.
## Reflection
An "authentic" somewhat can not really exist when speaking of co-construction with AI. Take the selfie example from this week. The pure and authentic self exists in the raw image that we can upload to these AI models; it represents us in our most pure form (physically speaking). The moment that we use AI to manipulate this image of ourselves, in any matter, we are no longer truly "authentic". Now, there is an argument to be made that AI can allow us to make a form of ourselves that we see as true, but this sparks more of a discussion of what being authentic truly means. So, assuming that authenticity means how we are in the current moment, then AI can not work along with identity construction. 
## Attribution & AI Use
- Tools used: DALL·E
- AI prompts (summary): generate a picture of me. I am an 18-year-old African American male. I am 5'8, and weight 185 pounds. I have an approximately 4-inch afro with a low taper. I have straight teeth, but one of my two front teeth is slightly larger than the other due to me chipping it when i was younger. 
- What AI generated: See above image
- What you changed or decided: I then asked DALL-E to give me slightly larger muscles, to clean up my hair, and then to change the lighting to that which you would find in a studio. I also asked to be put into streetwear clothes, like baggy jeans.
