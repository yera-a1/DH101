## Process Notes
I used Voyant and ChapGPT in the process of text analysis. With Voyant, I had to consider the data that was layed out in front of me, while with ChapGPT I was allowed to sit by as it summarized the text for me.

## Reflection
When machines read literature for us, we gain efficiency but lose competency. AI, as we have discussed previously, lacks a certain human "soul" or emotions, and while it can identify. It's not to say that it can not identify such emotions, but when it comes to understanding, it simply does not have the capacity to do so. So what does that mean when it interacts with literature, a very soulful and human medium? It makes for reflection that is devoid of any speculation or understanding.

Say that you want an AI to summarize a writing piece, for the sake of efficiency and time. The AI then pulls out a bulleted point summary of the reading, taking the subjective parts of it and putting it on the screen. You would be content with this theoretically, but let's say you then decide to actually read the passage to see how accurate it is. When you do, you see lots of small things that the AI missed. Non-essential or large ideas, but ones nonetheless that add to the overall meaning of the passage and interpretation of the reading. The AI had one task: to summarize. But it was not told to interact with the text, to think about it critically, or to think about what it means. There is no prompt you can tell the AI that would make it do this, as it simply can't. This is what is lost with AI. Critical interaction that allows for the finding of hidden and subtle meaning.
