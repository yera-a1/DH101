# Week 4 – Comic & Storytelling

## The Artifact
This comic works to demonstrate the bias that race can play in script generation.

## Process Notes
In this comic, I wanted to focus on the bias that AI can encapsulate in writing when the creator themselves is biased. For the generation of the dialogue for my comic, I began by describing each and every panel in detail. The setting, who was in it, and what actions were occurring were all things that I included when making the prompt for the AI generation. The element that I added that I wanted to test was what happens when I add the race that the generated text was going to represent. After some work (and prodding of the AI to get a little more biased, might I add), I was able to generate text that contained both an African American and a Caucasian dialect.
I originally was going to disclose which line was which dialect, but then I thought about keeping it ambiguous. My intentions here are to show how easy it is to build bias into an AI system. If we, the common person, have subconscious biases on how certain groups of people talk, then surely those who are designing these AI systems have the same. 
Overall, this make shows how AI bias can pervade storytelling when otherwise it could be possibly prevented through human construction. 


## Reflection
AI is a tool in the process of storytelling. When it comes to AI, it should be used as the means to an end to bring a creative idea forward. For example, take an artist who wants to create an artwork.  The artist has many different media they can use to try and convey their message, from something as simple as pencils and crayons to a complex thing such as stone sculpting. Among these media, I believe AI can help to guide us to the correct one in which to use (to an extent). When human input and thinking get the idea of a work to 90% completion, AI can help to bring that last 10% to reality and cement a direction to move in. We can now substitute the artist example for that of the storyteller. AI can help to guide thinking through giving a somewhat concrete example of what you want your end product to be.  When AI is used in this way, I believe it is being used to its best ability.
