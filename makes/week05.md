# Week 5 – GIF & Remix Culture

## The Artifact
This GIF shows the progression of the uploaded images overtime, with a 10 fps rate. The progression of the images is of a man, starting from having his eyes open with a blank expression to ending with his eyes closed with a smile on his face.

## Process Notes
In this case, I wanted to test AI’s knowledge of culture in general, to understand whether or not it can participate in the remix aspect of it. Starting off, I grabbed a stock image of a guy off the internet with his eyes closed, to act as the base for AI image generation. After I found an acceptable photo, I went to ChaptGPT. After that, I inserted the prompt “Make 15 photos from this picture, but make it show the evolution from having his eyes open to having it eyes closed with a smile like the Ishowspeed meme”. From there it generated only 12 photos that I then inserted into EZGIF to create an animated GIF.
The significance of this make is that it tests the lack of “soul” that AI is so famously claimed to have. The ishowspeed face meme is a popular bit of pop culture that most people know nowadays, and when asked to replicate it then would probably be able to do so very well. When it comes to the AI used here however, things get a little muddied. It may know who ishowspeed is, and what the meme consists of, but due to its limitations it can not completely capture the emotions that the face is meant to entail, because it does not understand them. In addition, the AI would also not even be able to make the connection of this image to a meme without human input. At the end of the day a robot, one of which lacks soul and understanding of human emotion. When asked to try and create and capture a funny emotion from a pop culture moment, its relies on human input, and even then, it creates something that lacks understanding and is devoid of a human emotion, and if we define it as such, a soul as well. 


## Reflection
AI is a tool in the process of storytelling. When it comes to AI, it should be used as the means to an end to bring a creative idea forward. For example, take an artist who wants to create an artwork.  The artist has many different media they can use to try and convey their message, from something as simple as pencils and crayons to a complex thing such as stone sculpting. Among these media, I believe AI can help to guide us to the correct one in which to use (to an extent). When human input and thinking get the idea of a work to 90% completion, AI can help to bring that last 10% to reality and cement a direction to move in. We can now substitute the artist example for that of the storyteller. AI can help to guide thinking through giving a somewhat concrete example of what you want your end product to be.  When AI is used in this way, I believe it is being used to its best ability. 
## Attribution & AI Use
- Tools used: ChaptGPT, EZGIF
- AI prompts (summary): Make 15 photos from this picture, but make it show the evolution from having his eyes open to having it eyes closed with a smile like the Ishowspeed meme.

- What AI generated: Only 12 images, of a guy starting with his eyes open and ending with an image with a guy with his eyes closed and a smile
- What you changed or decided: I remixed an already existing stock image of a guy, and generated the photos from it
